# semantic-similarity

This library will compute the similarity between two sentences or short corpus's

## Usage

One function is needed (get-sentence-similarity "Sentence one is awesome" "Sentence two is awsome")
DO NOT pass in any punctuation!

##Big O

This thing is terribly slow. O(N^2) is my guess, it may be more. I just hacked it together.
